# Stochastic Fractal Search In Python
Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm inspired from the concept of fractals, SFS was originally created by Dr Hamid Salimi in his 
article, named [Stochastic Fractal Search: A powerful metaheuristic algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950705114002822)

Fractals are impressive recursive structures and a major interest of computer graphics curriculum.

## Features
1. The algorithm is implemented in *sfs.py*, where benchmark functions could be tested effortlessly using [opteval](https://github.com/keit0222/optimization-evaluation) package
2. You may also view some random walk demos under walks directory.

## Original Matlab implementation
The original creator of SFS has published the Matlab code of the algorithm via [MATLAB Central File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47565-stochastic-fractal-search-sfs).
