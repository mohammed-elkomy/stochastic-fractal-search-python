# Stochastic Fractal Search In Python
Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm inspired from the concept of fractals, was originally created by Dr Hamid Salimi in his 
article, named [Stochastic Fractal Search: A powerful metaheuristic algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950705114002822)

Fractals are impressive recursive structures and a major interest of computer graphics literature:
